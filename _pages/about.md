Hi!
I am David Moravec, a dedicated remote sensing scientist primarily focusing on environmental applications. My career has been characterized by various research projects involving environmental classification, forest monitoring, climate phenomena analysis, and light pollution assessment. At present, my primary research concentration is on microwave sensing for moisture monitoring.

From the year 2024, I am an MSCA-CZ (Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions CZ) fellow at Matthias Forkel's lab Environmental Remote Sensing at TU Dresden!
