*WaCoRe - Woody Plant Water Content Assessment via Microwave Corner Reflection

The aim of the project is to develop a new method for monitoring forest stands using microwave satellite sensing with artificial or natural corner reflectors. 
This method can be used in the future to make more accurate estimates of moisture content, water potential, health, biomass and many other parameters of forests anywhere in the world.
